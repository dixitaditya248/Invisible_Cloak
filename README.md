Invisible-Cloak
In this post, we will learn how to create our own 'Invisibility Cloak' using simple computer vision technique in OpenCV .
Here I have written this code in Python because python provides exhaustive and sufficient library to build this program.
Here, we will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation.
Why Red? Sure, we could have used green or any other color also. ALOGRITHM:

Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect. [ video.mp4 ]
