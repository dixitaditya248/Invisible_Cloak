# Invisible-Cloak

In this project, we will learn how to create our own 'Invisibility Cloak' using a simple computer vision technique in OpenCV. The code is written in Python, as Python provides extensive and sufficient libraries to build this program. We will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called color detection and segmentation.

### Why Red?
Although we could have used green or any other color, red was chosen for this project due to its strong contrast with typical background environments.

### Algorithm:

1. Capture and store the background frame (done for a few seconds).
2. Detect the red-colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithms.
3. Segment out the red-colored cloth by generating a mask.
4. Generate the final augmented output to create the invisibility effect.
